"It _is_ a long tail, certainly," said Alice, looking down with wonder
at the Mouse's tail; "but why do you call it sad?" And she kept on
puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
tale was something like this:-

         "Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, `Let us both
         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_. Come, I'll take no
         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I've
         nothing to do.' Said the mouse to the cur, `Such a trial, dear
         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.'
         `I'll be judge, I'll be jury,' Said cunning old Fury: `I'll
         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.'"
         
"And that's the jury-box," thought Alice, "and those twelve creatures,"
(she was obliged to say "creatures," you see, because some of them were
animals, and some were birds,) "I suppose they are the jurors." She
said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather
proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little
girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, "jury-men"
would have done just as well.

"Consider your verdict," the King said to the jury.

"Write that down," the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

"Take off your hat," the King said to the Hatter.

"It isn't mine," said the Hatter.

"_Stolen!_" the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made
a memorandum of the fact.

"But what did the Dormouse say?" one of the jury asked.

idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the
jury-box, or they would die.

"The trial cannot proceed," said the King in a very grave voice, "until
all the jurymen are back in their proper places-_all_," he repeated
with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.

Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its

Some of the jury wrote it down "important," and some "unimportant."

The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. "Consider your
verdict," he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

"Who is it directed to?" said one of the jurymen.

"Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?" asked another of the jurymen.

"No, they're not," said the White Rabbit, "and that's the queerest
thing about it." (The jury all looked puzzled.)

"He must have imitated somebody else's hand," said the King. (The jury
