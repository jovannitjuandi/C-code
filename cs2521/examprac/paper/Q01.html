<h3>Question 1 <span class='tiny'>(15 marks)</span></h3>
<p>
Something on C programming ...
<p>
The code for this question is in the <tt>q1</tt> directory, which
contains:
<ul>
<li><tt>x.c</tt> ... main program for XXX</li>
<li><tt>y.c</tt> ... code for XXX</li>
<li><tt>Makefile</tt> ...for building the program</li>
<li><tt>tests/</tt> ... directory containing test cases</li>
</ul>
This contains a <tt>Makefile</tt> and several C program
files (<tt>*.c</tt> and <tt>*.h</tt>).
The program that you need to modify is contained in the file
<tt>XXX.c</tt>.
You can compile the program using the <tt>make</tt> command.
This will give you an executable file called <tt>XXX</tt>.
Examples of running the <tt>XXX</tt> command are given below.
</p>
<p>
You should complete the section of code marked with <tt>XXX</tt>.
You may write all of the code in the <tt>XXX()</tt> function;
you can define as many auxiliary functions as you want.
It requires around XXX lines of code to solve this problem; partial
marks are available if you complete some of the code.
</p>
<p>
Some hints on how to approach this problem:
</p>
<ul>
<li> take a quick look at ...
<li> read the block of comments in the main program near XXX, which gives you some hints on what to do
</ul>
<p>
Examples of how the program ought to behave when working correctly:
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>./XXX a b c</b>
...
</pre>
<p>
You should also be able to devise your own test cases.
</p>
<p>
To help you check whether your program is working correctly,
there is a script called <tt>run_tests.sh</tt> which will run
the program against all of the tests and report the results.
It will also add the output from your program into the 
<tt>tests</tt> directory; comparing your output against the
expected output might help you to debug your code.
You can run the testing script as:
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>sh run_tests.sh</b>
</pre>
<p>
Note that the output ... XXX
</p>
<p>
Once your function is working (passes all tests), follow
the submission instructions below.
Even if it fails some (or even all) tests, you should submit because
you can get <i>some</i> marks.
If your program does not compile, or if you simply submit
the supplied code, then your "answer" is worth zero marks.
</p>
<p><b>Submission Instructions:</b></p>
<ul>
<li> Type your answer to this question into the file called <tt>pages.c</tt>
<li> Submit via: &nbsp; <b><tt>give cs2521 exam_q1 pages.c</tt></b> <br>
	or via: Webcms3 &gt; exams &gt; Final Exam &gt; Submit Q<nobr>1</nobr> &gt; Make Submission
</ul>
