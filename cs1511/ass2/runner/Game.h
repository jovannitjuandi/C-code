// Get the number of cards that were in the initial deck.

//
// The turn number increases after a player ends their turn.
// The turn number should start at 0 once the game has started.

// Get the card that is on the top of the discard pile.
Card topDiscard(Game game);

// This function returns the number of turns that have occurred in the
// game so far including the current turn.
// (i.e. on turn 0 of the game, this should return 1, as there has been
//       1 turn so far including the current turn.)

// Get the number of moves (actions) that happened on the current turn.
//
// A turn may consist of multiple moves (actions) such as drawing cards,
// playing cards, and ending the turn.

// Get the number of consecutive cards with value "2" at the top of the

// For all other cases, the function returns the color of the card at 
// the top of the discard pile. 
int getCurrentColor(Game game);

// The function returns the player who played the previous turn.
// For example, if player 1 plays "A" in turn 12, player 3 will 
// play next turn 13. During turn 13, the following function will 
// return 1 (for player 1 who played the previous turn 12).
// If the current turn is the first turn (turn 0), the function should 
// return -1.

// the discard pile.

// Get the number of "active" cards with value "2" at the top of the 
// discard pile. 
// For example, say in turn-5 player-1 plays "2", as a result of this, 
// the function should return 1. Let's say in turn-6 player-2 
// draws two cards and is unable to play a card. 
// At the start of turn-7, the function should return zero.
// If the value of the top of the discard pile is not "2", the function
// should return zero.

int handCardCount(Game game);

// View a card from the current player's own hand.
//
// The player should not need to free() this card,
// so you should not allocate or clone an existing card
// but give a reference to an existing card.

// If no such card exists, the function returns NULL.
Card handCard(Game game, int card);

// Check if a given move is valid.
//
// If the last player played a 2 (DRAW_TWO),
// the next player must either play a 2
// or draw 2 cards.

// If the last player has NOT played a 2, 
// the player must play a card that is either a ZERO
// or that has the same color, value, or suit as the card on the top
// of the discard pile (adjust color for a case where the 
//   previous player has played a "D").
//
// If the player plays an "A", the next player's turn is skipped.
// If the player plays a "D", they must also state which color
// the next player's discarded card should be.
//
// A player can only play cards from their hand.
// A player may choose to draw a card instead of discarding a card.
// A player must draw a card if they are unable to discard a card.
//
// This check should verify that:
// * If a card is played, that card is from the player's hand, and matches 
//   the top card on the discard pile (adjust color for a case where the 
//   previous player has played a "D"), AND the player has not already
//   played a card during their turn.
// * If a DRAW_TWO was played, the player drew the appropriate number of cards.
// * If the player draws a card, either they have not yet drawn a card
//   during this turn OR a DRAW_TWO was played in the previous turn,
//   AND the player has not yet drawn the required number of cards.
//
// * The player has either played at least one card, or drawn at least
//   one card, before playing the END_TURN action.
